Ian's research interests center on behaviors that have traditionally been difficult to understand, measure, predict and influence, including implicit bias and suicidal behavior. 

He is interested in  function of behavior and the context it occurs in context (Behaviorism), measurement validity, statistical modelling (often Bayesian), and all things R/tidyverse. 

He is a strong proponent of Open Science practices, and won a 2019 commondation from the Society for the Improvement of Psychological Science (SIPS).
