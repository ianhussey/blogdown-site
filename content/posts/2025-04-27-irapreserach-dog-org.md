About mid-way through my PhD I created the [IRAPresearch.org](http://irapresearch.org/) website. For several years, it hosted a list of researchers who used the Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure in their work and a list of IRAP publications. I handed the website over to Dermot Barnes-Holmes in 2015 when I finished my PhD, who over time chose to disband the website and let the domain name lapse. It was bought up by a third party and was unavailable for several more years. I always thought this was a shame given that URLs to the website were included in several published IRAP articles.

It recently occured to me to check whether the domain name was availabe again, and it was, so I bought it. [IRAPresearch.org](http://irapresearch.org/) is now working again, and hosts links to my various publications and preprints that have led me to believe the IRAP is not fit for purpose. I continue to encourage researchers to employ methods other than the IRAP and pursue other lines of work, whether in Relational Frame Theory or implicit social cognition.
