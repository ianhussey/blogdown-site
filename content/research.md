My research interests focus on three inter-related topics related to Open Science and Meta-Science: forensic meta-science, the meta-science of measurement, and more general Open Science topics such as replications and Questionable Research Practices.

The below list both recent publications and current projects in various stages of development. Prospective students or postdocs should be aware that this page may not always be up to date, but should nontheless be useful to determining a fit between our interests. 

## Forensic meta-science

### Error detection

ERЯOR: A bug-bounty program for science

- Elson, M. (2024). A Bug Bounty Program for Science. Nature, 629, 730. https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-024-01465-y

### Forensic meta-science method and tool development 

#### "Forensic Meta-Science in Psychology" Slack group

I run the Slack group "Forensic Meta-Science in Psychology", which is one of several groups for sleuths. This group has a particular focus on psychology, tool development, and is orientated towards encouraging Early Career Researcher involvement. Contact me with your relevant interests and experience if would like to join. 

#### Granularity-based testing via GRIM & GRIMMER

- I drafted the GRIM & GRIMMER guide for the Collection of Open Science Integrity Guides (COSIG, see https://cosig/net).
- Our lab support's the hosting of Lukas Jung's excellent Shiny web app and R package {scrutiny}, see https://errors.shinyapps.io/scrutiny.

#### Bounds-based testing via TIDES 

- Web app demo: https://errors.shinyapps.io/TIDES
- R package: https://github.com/ianhussey/tides

#### Intuitiions for the plausibility of effect-sizes

- https://errors.shinyapps.io/effect_size_percentiles/

## Meta-science of measurement

### Psychology: the science of behavior?

Psychology's self-image is that we are the science of behavior, but Baumeister et al. (2007) argued that we collect measurements of actual behavior with increasing rarity, undermining this self-image. This project defines different modes of measurement in psychology and examines trends over time. Stage 1 Registered Report under review at PCI: Registered Reports

### Instances of schmeasurement

#### Measurement flexiblity in the Iowa Gambling Task: A meta-methods study

Aka "the Iowa Gambling task is actually dozens of different tasks in a trenchcoat". Project nearly ready for pre-printing.

#### Item-content overlap analyses

Fried's (2016) compared the overlap in the symptoms measured by common depression scales. Some of my current students run item-content overlap studies in other domains, including suicidal ideation and Alcohol Use Disorder.  

#### The Implicit Association Test has poor individual-level utility

#### The Implicit Relational Assessment Procedure is a poor measure
